## Database Integration Points

### API Endpoints Created
All endpoints are structured to work with your database schema:

```
/api/admin/leads
  GET - Fetch all leads
  POST - Create new lead

/api/admin/leads/[id]
  GET - Fetch specific lead
  PATCH - Update lead status
  DELETE - Delete lead

/api/admin/programs
  GET - Fetch all programs with institution names
  POST - Create new program

/api/admin/programs/[id]
  GET - Fetch specific program
  PATCH - Update program
  DELETE - Delete program

/api/admin/institutions
  GET - Fetch all institutions
  POST - Create new institution

/api/admin/institutions/[id]
  GET - Fetch specific institution
  PATCH - Update institution
  DELETE - Delete institution
```

## Type Definitions
All types are derived from your database schema:

```typescript
// Lead type matches leads table
interface Lead {
  id, fullName, email, phone, gender, dob, state, city,
  employmentStatus, salaryBand, highestQualification,
  lastScorePercent, degreeInterest, coursePreference,
  specialisationInterest, goal, budgetRange, wantsEmi,
  category, experienceYears, preferredMode, status,
  notes, consentedAt, source, utmCampaign
}

// Program type matches programs table
interface Program {
  id, institutionId, degreeType, title, durationMonths,
  deliveryMode, totalFee, applicationFee, emiAvailable,
  highlights, outcomes, eligibility, curriculum,
  workExperienceMinYears, isFeatured, brochureUrl,
  heroImage, applyUrl, applicationDeadline
}

// Institution type matches institutions table
interface Institution {
  id, name, slug, location, accreditation, website,
  heroImage, logoUrl, establishedYear, shortDescription
}
```

## Navigation & UI

### Header Navigation
- Logo: Upskillers branding with teal gradient
- Tabs: Overview, Leads, Programs, Institutions

- Logout: Clears authentication

### Modals

1. **Lead Detail Modal**
   - Displays all lead information in 2-column grid
   - Status badge with color coding
   - Delete button for lead removal
   - Close button

2. **Program Modal** (Placeholder)
   - Ready to connect to API
   - Template for add/edit forms
   - Will include all program fields

3. **Institution Modal** (Placeholder)
   - Ready to connect to API
   - Template for add/edit forms
   - Will include all institution fields

## Sample Data
Dashboard includes sample data for demo:
- 3 sample leads with varied statuses
- 2 sample programs from Manipal University
- 2 sample institutions (Manipal & NMIMS)

## CSS & Styling
- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Color Scheme**: Teal/Emerald (matching site theme)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design, works on all screen sizes
- **Hover States**: Smooth transitions on interactive elements

## Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### 1. Connect Database
Replace API endpoint TODO comments with actual Drizzle ORM queries:

```typescript
// Example for GET /api/admin/leads
import { db } from '@/db';
import { leads } from '@/db/schema';

export async function GET() {
  const leadsData = await db.select().from(leads);
  return NextResponse.json(leadsData);
}
```

### 2. Implement Program & Institution Forms
Replace modal placeholders with actual forms containing all fields from schema

### 3. Add Authentication Middleware
Verify admin token/session in API routes before allowing CRUD operations

### 4. Email Notifications
Implement email alerts when:
- New lead submitted
- Lead status changed
- Program added/modified

### 5. Advanced Features
- Lead program matching algorithm
- Bulk operations (export, status update)
- Analytics dashboard
- Audit logs
- Role-based access control

```

## Authentication
- Uses localStorage for session management
- Checks `adminAuth` and `adminEmail` from login page
- Redirects to /admin if not authenticated
- Logout clears both values

## Demo Credentials
```
Email: admin@upskillers.com
Password: admin123
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- No external dependencies beyond Next.js & Tailwind
